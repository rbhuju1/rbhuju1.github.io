      The story of Quakertown begins in 1875 when 27 families from the White
      Rock area of Dallas moved two miles south of the Denton Square to a new
      settlement, they called Freedman Town. 
      <br>They created the first community that truly belonged to them called: Quakertown. 
      A small community located close to the central business district of Denton. </br>
      Quakertown, named in honor of the abolitionist Quakers who helped slaves traveling the
      Underground Railroad, developed into a thriving community by the 1910s
      with over fifty African American families and several locally-owned
      businesses. 
      <br> However, the 1920s saw the end of Quakertown after the city
      relocated the entire Quakertown community to make room for the Denton
      Civic Center Park.</br>
